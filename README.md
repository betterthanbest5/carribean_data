# carribean_storm_data

Hello,

I am Tri Cao, a Sophmore at the University of Arizona. I am currently a double major
studing both Statistics and Data Science (SDS) as well as Information Science and Technology (ISTA).

In this project we will be discussing how carribean storms have been affected by climate change and 
figure out if we can predict the next tropical storm's wind speed. 

Thank You!
